Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We use pixi.js for game development, which is a beginner-friendly JavaScript library.

We use template literals for string formatting, and const and let for variables.

We use || and && in conditionals when necessary.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code, especially when debugging.

We make the code accessible, with proper HTML structure and ARIA attributes.
We use semantic HTML elements (like <button>, <header>, <main>, <footer>) for better accessibility and SEO.
We use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles in HTML.

We use responsive design principles to ensure the game works well on different screen sizes.
We use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout to create responsive designs.
We ensure the game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

We use object oriented programming design to create modular code. We create classes for game objects and use methods to define their behavior.
We use ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and spread/rest operators where appropriate.
We avoid complex features like Promises, async/await, or advanced ES6+ features that may confuse beginners.
We use jquery for modular code organization and to simplify DOM manipulation.
